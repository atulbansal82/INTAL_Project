# INTAL_Project

#Overview:
The maximum limit of Unsigned Long Int in C is 18446744073709551615, a 20 digit
number. While languages like Java support classes of BigIntegers (100 digit numbers).
C by default has no such support. This project aims to bring that support to the C language
along with basic arithmetic operations like Comparison, Addition, Subtraction,
Multiplication and Division along with applications such as Factorial, Fibonacci.
